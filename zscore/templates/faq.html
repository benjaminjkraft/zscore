<h2>About the Metrics</h2>

<p><i>Q: What do the different metrics mean?</i></p>
<p>A: The <b>avg</b> is, surprisingly enough, the average of your sleep per day.  But that doesn't account for consistency of sleep at all.  So the <b>stDev</b> is the standard deviation of your sleep per day.  (Note that it uses sample standard deviation, using the formula Wikipedia <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_standard_deviation#Unbiased_sample_standard_deviation">suggests</a>.)  This doesn't account for sleeping enough, so the <b>zScore</b> is one simple way of combining them: it's the average minus the standard deviation.  Both still penalize you for sleeping a lot in some cases, so <b>posStDev</b> and <b>zPScore</b> only count the negative deviations from the mean in computing the metrics.<br/><br/>

Another way of accounting for consistent sleep is to have some sort of diminishing returns on sleeping a whole lot on a single day.  So consider some concave-down increasing function <i>f</i>.  (We stipulate increasing to make it so that sleeping more always increases your score, a property that the zScore unfortunately doesn't satisfy.)  Now apply <i>f</i> to your sleep each day, average those values, and then take <i>f</i><sup>-1</sup> of the average, in order to make the answer correspond roughly to hours of sleep.  If we take <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=&radic;<i>x</i>, this gives us the <b>avgSqrt</b> metric, which we can also think of as the 0.5-<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_mean">power mean</a>.  If we take <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) to be log <i>x</i> or 1 - 1/<i>x</i>, we get the geometric or harmonic respectively.  Both would blow up when <i>x</i>=0, so we add an offset, currently 1 hour, then subtract it at the end.  So <b>avgLog</b> has <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=log(<i>x</i> + 1 hour) and <b>avgRecip</b> has <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=1 - 1/(<i>x</i> + 1 hour).  We don't have a great understanding of the qualitative difference between the three, to be honest, but they each penalize inconsistency a bit differently.</p>

<p>The idealDev measures your deviance from max(the amount of sleep you set as your ideal amount of sleep, the average amount of sleep you got).</p>

<p><i>Q: Over what time period are the stats computed?  And what's this exponentially decaying thing?</i></p>
<p>A: The exponentially decaying average is a weighted average over all time, where the sleep from <i>n</i> days ago has a weight of 2<sup>-<i>n</i>/4</sup>, i.e., the weights have a half-life of 4 days.  This counts all sleep, but counts recent sleep (the last week or so) for the most.  We also compute averages over all time ("global") and over the last 7 days ("weekly").  The leaderboard uses the exponentially decaying average.</p>

<p><i>Q: What's this Fourier business?</i></p>
<p>A: It measures the periodic components of your sleep.  For example, if your highest Fourier mode has a period of 2 and a weight of 3:00, that means that the biggest periodic component of your sleep is that you alternate between sleeping 3 hours more than average and sleeping 3 hours less than average.  Similarly, if you see lots of Fourier modes at around 7 days, that means you have weekly patterns in your sleep.</p>
